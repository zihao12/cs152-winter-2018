=== what to do ===

This code is largely complete, but has a few critical omissions. Find
all the instances of the word TODO in the code, and fill in the
missing operations. You can find these quickly by typing

  $ grep TODO *.c

at the command line.

=== how to use ===

The file graph.c includes a function 

  graph *sample_graph(unsigned int selection)

For 0, 1 and 2 sample_graph will return three different graphs. 
Read the code to see their characteristics. Running bfs or dfs
with a number 0, 1, 2 will select a graph and traverse it like so:

  $ ./bfs 0
  --- graph ---
  begin graph
   vertex(0,"x",not done) []
  end graph

  --- breadth-first search ---
  [0:"x"]

No argument or an argument out of range will select graph 0.

Run

  $ make clean

to remove everything but the source code.

You can modify the code yourself (see sample_graph) to add your own
graphs as you see fit.
