Besides this README, this directory includes the following files:

- a Makefile for the project

- contact-info.tsv, a file with randomly-generated tab-delimited
  fictional contact information; any similarities to actual persons
  are coincidental

- adrbook.h, a header file including struct definitions and
  function prototypes for vcard and bst operations

- vcard.c: unfinished

- bst.c: unfinished

- shell.h and shell.c, simple common shell actions 

- cmd.h and cmd.c, datatype for user commands

- adrbook.c, which runs a shell "adrbook" for interacting with the 
  binary search tree address book

To be clear: the only files you need to edit for this lab are vcard.c
and bst.c.
