/*** correctness ***/

- design of deanon struct              /10/10
- deanon_new                           / 2/2

- deanon_preprocess
 - can add addresses     	           / 6/6 /* via add_address or some other function(s) */
 - can add associations                / 6/6 /* via add_associations or some other function(s) */
 - does add all addresses              / 6/6 /* even addresses that aren't transaction inputs */
 - does add sufficient associations    / 6/6 /* not all associations have to be added for all clusters to be found */

- get_cluster
 - computes cluster correctly          /11/12 one little problem, if the cluster only has one address, your program does not return that cluster of size 1
 - O(|v|+|e|) on first call            / 6/6
 - O(1) after first call               / 6/6

- cluster_size                         / 5/5
- cluster_balance		               / 5/5

- cluster_new                          / 3/3
- cluster_free                         / 3/3
                                       
- free of memory leaks	      	       / 5/5

- code layout                          / 3/3
- identifiers are well named           / 3/3
                                       
- functions are well designed          / 3/3
- code is well factored                / 4/4  /* e.g., free of copied-and-pasted blocks of code */
                                       
- code is written clearly              / 3/3  /* i.e., avoid Byzantine logic */
- code is efficient                    / 3/3  /* i.e., avoid blatant inefficiencies */
